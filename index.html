        <p>I am sitting here thinking it could be worse. And that is a change a really remarkable change that I've gone from. A week ago <strong>COVID19</strong> was something academic that was affecting other people - like a volcano eruption or SARS1. Sure things were bad but it was a local bad and if it did come my way it was mild or undifferentiated from the noise of life. Does that make sense? The ash from an eruption would affect the weather here but so what? It's weather. But now I am starting my self-imposed hermitage and well it is a bit frightening. </p>
        <p>Long term, yes, the human race will deal with this and deaths are sitting at around <a href="https://ncov2019.live/data">6K</a>, maybe that will number will triple, maybe it will quadruple. I don't know and I am not in a position to know. What I do know is that this could be the new normal until a vaccine becomes available - 18 to 24 months. 18 to 24 months of living like this where we <em>have to</em> become dependent on automation and technology for certain things. Bluntly some jobs were on their way out, this might have killed them off as businesses learn to business with less humans.</p>

      <h3 class="post-title">Well, that escalated quickly</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>This is the thing that is bothering me, the best case scenario is that we've got a month holed up and then the epidemic will pass. The worst case scenario is that we have an R0(transmission rate) that doesn't dip below 1 and that because the virus travels the world it becomes something that is seasonal. However, there is at least 1 more cold season between us and a manufactured vaccine (18-24 months does not leave a lot of wiggle room). The other real risk is that there are a significant chunk of the US that does not have <em>routine</em> access to medical advice and assistance, meaning it is <strong>likely</strong> that these folks could act an internal reservoir. </p>
        <p>So part of the thing with me is that I want to look for work that is remote.</p>
